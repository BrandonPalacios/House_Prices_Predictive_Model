# House_Prices_Predictive_Model
## Predictive Analysis of House Prices (Spanish version)

I created a Lineal Regression Model to predict the House Prices importing the dataset from Kaggle.

### **The project is divided in 4 phases:**
1. Data Collection
2. Dataset Exploration
  - *Dataframe Exploration*
  - *Visual Exploration*
3. Training and Validation  

For the project I used the Scikit learn library to create a Train and Split models and used linear regression.
To ensure the model performace I created & validated 6 different hypothesis using diffrent methods. Choosing the hypothesis 4 using a StandardScaler to predict the variable.
